# Vietnamese

As I spend most of my time inside my IDE writing code, I thought I'd do the same for learning Vietnamese.

My current thinking is to use files and folders in my own private Github repo too.

Same tooling, same approach...less "friction".

And, while I'm at it, I'll be able to combine coding and learning Vietnamese!  
That is, create silly little scripts and flashcards to help learn the vocabulary.
